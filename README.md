# Fraud-detection-knime
A predictive model for fraud detection analysis for a Bank, built with KNIME. This project is based on Supervised learning classification. Tried with CNNs as well during the development phase but due to small number of fraud cases in data sets the appropriate method selected was Decision trees, Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
